class 'user' 
 - for looking up individual users, etc. not much in it

class 'users'
 - handles login/logout, registration

model 'sessions_model' and library 'my_session'
 - takes over from standard CI session class
 - keep track of inactivity, etc
 - refresh session info in the database. no need to store IP or useragent, so we use our own class.
 - upon login, need to createSession(userhash), then simply including library will maintain the data
 - login when already logged in, will check for inactivity. 
 -                 $this->my_session->checkAuth('login'); or 'vendor' or 'admin' to restrict page access
 - trying not to use username in the database or session, no need to have it. 

class 'currencies'
 - started putting the symbol onto the products pages

library 'my_captcha'
 - our own captcha class, uses the built in one for the image.
 - tracks users with a unique captcha key held in a session, rather than an IP address.
 
library layout
 - include this library when the data['title'] data['page'] variables are set
 - just call library, constructor does everything with data array, remaining info goes to the view.
 - this function is the only function to call this->load->view()
 - 'do not repeat yourself'
 - looks up session info for appropriate header (buyer/seller/admin/not logged in)

class 'pages'
 - sorted out 404's

started populating form_validation rules in application/config/form_validation.php so everything is global
			form validation errors in application/language/english/form_validation_lang.php

library 'my_image' 
 - links in with images_model
 - returns the base64 string from the DB, identified by the filename of the original image.
 - possibly some sort of redundancy for IE browsers which can't use base64 in <img> tags, keep cleaned 
	images in a folder for access. encourage better browsers!

model 'images'
 - used to pull encoded images from the DB. 

model 'products'
 - moved the product images function to here. Product controller calls its model to get image filenames, which calls
	images model for the base64 text. 

next to do:
	- review of security of what's been done so far!
	secure uploads, finish images class
	account info
	categories
	add listings - there are PHP functions for scrubbing metadata!
	instant messaging system
	bitcoin integration ***
	move applications, system, etc out from DOCUMENT_ROOT

--------------------------------------
-- Notes from Review -----------------
--------------------------------------

 - The sessions lib is being included in multiple locations throughout the code. As it going to be used
   almost universally it can instead be included in /application/config/autoload.php 

 - Similarly $this->my_session->checkAuth is being performed in a number of different locations which
   makes it easier for it to be left out and result in security issues. We should look at drawing out
   structure of each control and decide which functionality should be implemented where. Any duplicated
   code should be refactored to avoid repeating ourselves.

 - What is the purpose of the home controller, it looks like it just duplicates the image class.
   
 - What are the differences between the user and the users class, These are interacting with one model, 
   so shouldn't they be one class? We can extend the class if needed rather than creating extra controllers.
